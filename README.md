# ShacoBuild
Takes two league of legends team compositions and outputs whether to build Assassin Shaco or AP Box Control Shaco.
Currently a WIP. Last updated 11/9/2022.
The software will ask you to input your team's champions and the enemy team's champions and depending on the predetermined traits for that character (their damage type,
whether they are ranged/melee, if they are dive or poke, etc.)
It will store these team comps in an array and look at each champions attributes and output a result. 

To Do:
Decide when to build tanko
